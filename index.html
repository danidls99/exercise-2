            The first three dimensions—length, height, and depth—are included on all topographical maps.
             The “fourth dimension,” or time, is also available on the website of the <span class="hover-title">Swiss</span>
             <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/swisscheese.png" /></span> Federal Office 
             of Topography (Swisstopo). In the “Journey Through Time,” a timeline displays 175 years of the
              country’s cartographic history, advancing in increments of 5-10 years. Over the course of two 
              minutes, Switzerland is drawn and redrawn with increasing precision: inky shapes take on hard 
              edges, blues and browns appear after the turn of the century, and in 2016, the letters drop their
               serifs.
            Watching a single place evolve over time reveals small histories and granular inconsistencies. 
            Train stations and airports are built, a gunpowder factory disappears for the length of the Cold War.
             But on certain maps, in Switzerland’s more remote regions, there is also, curiously, a <span class="hover-title">spider,</span>
             <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/spider.png" /></span> a <span class="hover-title">a man's face,</span>
             <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/desperateman.jpeg" /></span> <span class="hover-title">a naked woman,</span>
             <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/venus.jpg" /></span> a <span class="hover-title">hiker,</span>
             <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/hiker.png" /></span>
              a <span class="hover-title">fish,</span>
              <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/fish.png" /></span> and a <span class="hover-title">marmot.</span><span class="hover-image"><img src="images/marmot.png" /></span>
              These barely-perceptible apparitions aren’t mistakes, but rather illustrations hidden by the official cartographers at 
              Swisstopo in defiance of their mandate “to reconstitute reality.” Maps published by Swisstopo undergo a rigorous proofreading
               process, so to find an illicit drawing means that the cartographer has outsmarted his colleagues. 
            It also implies that the mapmaker has openly violated his commitment to accuracy, risking professional repercussions on 
            account of an alpine rodent. No cartographer has been fired over these drawings, but then again, most were only
             discovered once their author had already left. (Many mapmakers timed the publication of their drawing to coincide
              with their <span class="hover-title">retirement</span><span class="hover-image"><img src="images/retirement.png" /></span>.) Over half of the known illustrations have been removed. The latest, the <span class="hover-title">marmot</span><span class="hover-image"><img src="images/marmot.png" /></span> drawing,
               was discovered by Swisstopo in 2016 and is likely to be eliminated from the next official map of Switzerland 
               by next year. As the spokesperson for Swisstopo told me, “Creativity has no place on these maps.”

            Errors—both accidental and deliberate—are not uncommon in map s<span class="hover-title">(17th-century California as an island, </span>
            <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/caliisland.png" /></span> 
            the omission of Seattle in a 1960s AAA map). Military censors have long transformed nuclear bunkers 
            into nondescript warehouses and routinely pixelate satellite images of sensitive sites. Many maps also
             contain intentional errors to trap would-be copyright violators. The work of recording reality is 
             particularly vulnerable to plagiarism: if a cartographer is suspected of copying another’s work, he 
             can simply claim to be duplicating the real world— ideally, the two should be the same. Mapmakers often
              rely on fictitious streets, typically no longer than a block, to differentiate their accounts of the
               truth <span class="hover-title">(Oxygen Street in Edinburgh, for example).</span>
               <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/oxygenst.png" /></span>
    </p>
    <p>
            But there is another, less institutional reason to hide something in a map. According to Lorenz Hurni, 
            professor of cartography at ETH Zurich, these illustrations are part inside joke, part coping mechanism. 
            Cartographers are “quite meticulous, really high-precision people,” he says. Their entire professional 
            life is spent at the magnification level of a <span class="hover-title">postage stamp</span>
            <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/stamp.png" /></span>. To sustain this kind of concentration, Hurni 
            suspects that they eventually “look for something to break out of their daily routine.” The satisfaction of 
            these illustrations comes from their transgressive nature— the labor and secrecy required to conceal one of these visual puns.
            And some of them enjoy remarkable longevity. The <span class="hover-title">naked woman</span>
            <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/venus.jpg"/></span> drawing, for example, remained hidden for almost 
            sixty years in the municipality of <span class="hover-title">Egg,</span><span class="hover-image"><img src="images/egg.png" /></span> in northern Switzerland. Her relatively understated shape was composed 
            in 1958 from a swath of green countryside and the blue line of a river, her knees bending at the curve in the 
            stream. She remained unnoticed, reclining peacefully, until 2012. 
    </p>      
    <p>
            Several of the other drawings came about considerably later. In 1980, a Swisstopo cartographer traced the <span class="hover-title">spider</span>
            <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/spider.png" /></span> 
            over an arachnid-shaped ice field on the <span class="hover-title">Eiger Mountain</span>
            <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/eiger.jpg" /></span>. It faded out over the course of the decade, retracting 
            its spindly legs in the intermediary editions. Around the same time, another cartographer concealed a <span class="hover-title">freshwater fish</span>
            <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/fish.png" /></span> in a French nature preserve along the Swiss border. The <span class="hover-title">fish</span>
            <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/fish.png" /></span> lived in the blue circumference of a marshy lake
             until 1989 when, according to Swisstopo, “it disappeared from the surface of the lake, diving to the depths.”
            It’s unclear how these drawings made it past the institute’s proofreaders in the first place. They may have been
             inserted only after the maps were approved, when cartographers are asked to apply the proofreaders’ final edits. 
             When the maps were once printed as composite layers of different colors, cartographers could have built the drawings
              from the interplay of different topographical elements (the <span class="hover-title">naked woman,</span>
              <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/venus.jpg" /></span> for example, is composed of a blue line 
              over a green-shaded area). Hurni also speculates that cartographers could have partitioned their illustrations over
               the corners of four separate map sheets, although no such example has (yet) been found.
    </p> 
    <p>
            Some of these clandestine drawings allude to actual topographical features: near the town of Interlaken, 
            where an outcropping of <span class="hover-title">stones approximates two eyes and a nose</span>
            <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/stones.png" /></span>, the 1980 edition of the map features an angular
             cartoon face between the trees. (According to local legend, it’s a <span class="hover-title">monk</span>
             <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/monk.jpg" /></span> who was turned to stone as punishment for
              chasing a young girl off the cliff.) In the late 1990s, the same cartographer drew a <span class="hover-title">hiker</span>
              <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/hiker.png" /></span> in the map’s margins. 
              With boots each about the size of a house, the <span class="hover-title">hiker</span>
              <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/hiker.png" /></span> serves a pragmatic purpose. Like a kind of topographic patch, 
              he covers an area in the Italian Alps where the Swiss apparently lacked the necessary “information and data from the 
              Italian geographical services.”
            
    </p>
    <p>
            The <span class="hover-title">marmot</span><span class="hover-image"><img src="images/marmot.png" /></span>, the latest illustration, hides in plain sight in the Swiss Alps. His plump outline was concealed in the 
            delicate relief shading above a glacier, which shielded him from detection for nearly five years. The mountain’s 
            hachures— short, parallel lines that indicate the angle and orientation of a slope— double as his fur. He is mostly 
            indistinguishable from the surrounding rock, except for his face, tail, and paws. He even fits ecologically: as an 
            animal of the ice age, alpine <span class="hover-title">marmot</span><span class="hover-image"><img src="images/marmot.png" /></span> are comfortable at high altitudes, burrowing into frozen rock for their nine 
            months of hibernation. In 2016, Hurni revealed his location to the public on behalf of an unnamed source.
            There is a degree of winking tolerance for these drawings, which constitute something of an unofficial national
             tradition: the spokeswoman for Swisstopo referred me to a 1901 fish hidden in a well-known painting of Lake Lucerne 
             at the National Council palace (probably in honor of the palace’s April 1st inauguration, which some European countries 
             celebrate by attaching <span class="hover-title">"April Fish"</span>
             <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/aprilfish.jpg"/></span> to the backs of shirts). Nevertheless, the <span class="hover-title">marmot</span><span class="hover-image"><img src="images/marmot.png" /></span>—along with the <span class="hover-title">face</span>
             <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/desperateman.jpeg"/></span> and <span class="hover-title">hiker</span>
             <span class="hover-image"><img src="images/hiker.png" /></span>—will
              likely be “eliminated” from Switzerland’s next official map (per a decision from the chief of cartography).
    </p>

            Swiss cartographers have a longstanding reputation for topographical rigor. A so-called “Seven Years War of Cartography” 
            was even waged in the 1920s over the scale of the national maps, with the Swiss Alpine Club advocating greater topographical 
            detail for its mountaineering members. Swisstopo is now an industry benchmark for the mountains, from its use of aerial 
            photogrammetry (images taken first by balloons and then small planes) to aerial perspective (that natural haziness that 
            renders distant peaks with less contrast). In 1988, they were commissioned to draw Mount Everest.
            Still, the original drawings were never authorized in the first place. Perhaps a meticulous reading of next year’s 
            Swiss maps may reveal some other nationally-celebrated animals in unfrequented bodies of water or alpine meadows.
             As Juerg Gilgen, a current cartographer at Swisstopo, told me “as a matter of fact, the proof-reader is also just
              a human being prone to failure. And cartographers are also just human beings trying to fool around.”
